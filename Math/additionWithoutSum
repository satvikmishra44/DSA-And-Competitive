int Solution::addNumbers(int A, int B) {
    
    //  Approach is simple by using bitwise operators
    // A ^ B XOR gives the sum but ignores the carry, so we have to get the carry before and store it into B until when the B reaches zero, meaning, it doesn't have anything to carry and summation is complete.
    while(B!=0){
        // Generating Carry
        int carry = A & B;
        // Summation without carry
        A = A ^ B;
        // Passing the carry to B now
        B = carry << 1;
